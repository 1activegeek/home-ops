# Authentik Forward Auth SecurityPolicy Component
#
# This component creates a SecurityPolicy with Authentik forward-auth
# that OVERRIDES the gateway-level default for specific customization needs.
#
# When to use this component:
# - You need path-specific auth rules (protect /ui, allow /api/webhook)
# - You need custom headers forwarded to/from Authentik
# - You want different failOpen settings for specific apps
#
# Most apps should NOT need this - the gateway-level default is sufficient.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Create HTTPRoute(s) for your app
#   2. Include this component in the app's kustomization.yaml
#   3. Use replacements to target the correct HTTPRoute name
#
# Example kustomization.yaml:
#
#   components:
#     - ../../../../components/authentik-forward-auth
#
#   replacements:
#     - source:
#         kind: HTTPRoute
#         name: my-protected-route
#         fieldPath: metadata.name
#       targets:
#         - select:
#             kind: SecurityPolicy
#             name: forward-auth
#           fieldPaths:
#             - spec.targetRefs.0.name
#             - metadata.name
#           options:
#             delimiter: '-'
#             index: 1
#
# This SecurityPolicy applies the SAME auth as gateway-level default,
# but allows you to customize settings or target specific routes.

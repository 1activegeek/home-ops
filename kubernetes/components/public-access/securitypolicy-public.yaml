# Public Access SecurityPolicy Component
#
# This component creates a SecurityPolicy that DISABLES authentication
# for a specific HTTPRoute. Use this to explicitly opt-out of the
# gateway-level default auth (envoy-external-default-auth).
#
# Usage:
#   1. Include this component in the app's kustomization.yaml
#   2. Use replacements to target the correct HTTPRoute name
#
# Example kustomization.yaml:
#
#   components:
#     - ../../../../components/public-access
#
#   replacements:
#     - source:
#         kind: HTTPRoute
#         name: my-public-route
#         fieldPath: metadata.name
#       targets:
#         - select:
#             kind: SecurityPolicy
#             name: public-access
#           fieldPaths:
#             - spec.targetRefs.0.name
#             - metadata.name
#           options:
#             delimiter: '-'
#             index: 1
#
# This SecurityPolicy OVERRIDES the gateway-level default, disabling auth
# for the specific route it targets.

### Build Validation
- **Helm Template Check:** Successfully renders manifests with env as map and envSecrets properly injecting HOMARR_PASSWORD and SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY via secretKeyRef.
- **Flux-Local Compatibility:** Unavailable due to Python 3.14 compatibility issues, but Helm template validates structure.
- **Security Compliance:** All secrets handled via External Secrets; no plaintext in Git.

### Hand-off to Testarr
Artifacts prepared on 'homarr' branch. Ready for validation and simulation testing.

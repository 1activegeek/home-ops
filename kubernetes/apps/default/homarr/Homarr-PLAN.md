### Approval for Deployment
Build approved for deployment. No re-build required. Ready for hand-off to Deployarr.

### Deployment Staging
- **Hostname Configuration:** Configured with default `homarr.${SECRET_DOMAIN}` and additional `home.${SECRET_DOMAIN}` for user flexibility.
- **Manifest Updates:** Integrated HTTPRoute into Helm chart; removed standalone HTTPRoute resource for streamlined management.
- **Flux Reconciliation:** Prepared for GitOps rollout via Flux Kustomization in default namespace.
- **Validation:** Flux-local validation skipped due to Python 3.14 compatibility issues; Helm template rendering confirms structure.
- **PR Update:** Latest changes committed and pushed to homarr branch for PR #5 merge preparation.

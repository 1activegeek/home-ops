### Test Results
- **Helm Chart Rendering:** Successfully rendered Homarr chart v8.2.1 using Helm template with provided values. No template errors detected. All resources (Deployment, Service, PVC, HTTPRoute) generated correctly.
- **OCIRepository Validation:** API version v1 confirmed correct. layerSelector with mediaType "application/vnd.cncf.helm.chart.content.v1.tar+gzip" is appropriate for Helm chart content selection.
- **HelmRelease Validation:** API version v2 confirmed correct. chartRef structure (kind: OCIRepository, name: homarr, version: "8.2.1") is valid for referencing OCI charts.
- **Compatibility Check:** Manifests are compatible with Flux v2.7.2 and Kubernetes v1.34.1. HTTPRoute uses Gateway API v1, matching Envoy Gateway configuration.
- **Issue Identified and Fixed:** OCIRepository ref.tag was set to "latest", but HelmRelease chartRef.version is "8.2.1". Updated OCIRepository ref.tag to "8.2.1" for version consistency and proper pinning.
- **Security and Best Practices:** Secrets handled via External Secrets (envSecrets using existingSecret). SecurityContext applied with non-root user and read-only filesystem. Resources limits and requests set appropriately.
- **Test Status:** PASS - All validations successful after fix.

### Approval for Deployment
Build approved for deployment after fixing version inconsistency. Ready for hand-off to Deployarr.

### Deployment Errors and Fixes
- **Issue Identified:** Initial deployment failed due to incorrect image configuration in HelmRelease values. The image.repository was set to "homarr/homarr" instead of the correct "ghcr.io/homarr-labs/homarr", and image.tag was "8.2.1" (chart version) instead of "v1.43.1" (app version).
- **Fixes Applied:**
  - Updated OCIRepository to API version v1 (already correct).
  - Ensured layerSelector with mediaType "application/vnd.cncf.helm.chart.content.v1.tar+gzip" (already correct).
  - Confirmed HelmRelease uses chartRef with kind: OCIRepository, name: homarr, version: "8.2.1" (already correct).
  - Fixed image.repository to "ghcr.io/homarr-labs/homarr".
  - Fixed image.tag to "v1.43.1" for proper version pinning.
- **Expected Resolution:** Correct image reference should allow the Deployment to pull the proper Homarr container image, resolving pull errors and enabling successful rollout.
- **Validation:** Chart v8.2.1 exists in OCI repository. Image ghcr.io/homarr-labs/homarr:v1.43.1 should be available.

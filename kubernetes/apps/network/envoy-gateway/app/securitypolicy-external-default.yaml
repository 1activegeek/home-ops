# Gateway-level SecurityPolicy for envoy-external
# Applies Authentik forward-auth to ALL external routes by default
#
# This provides default-deny security posture:
# - ALL routes through envoy-external are protected by Authentik
# - Individual routes can override with more specific HTTPRoute-level policies
# - To disable auth for a route (webhooks, health checks), create a
#   HTTPRoute-level SecurityPolicy with empty extAuth
#
# Protected by default:
# - All applications exposed via envoy-external Gateway
#
# Exceptions (must explicitly opt-out):
# - Public routes (Authentik login page, webhooks, APIs)
# - Routes with native OIDC integration (can create HTTPRoute-level policy)

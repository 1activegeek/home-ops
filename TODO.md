# Tasks & Ideas

## Core Infra to Deploy
- [x] Implement External Secrets Operator
- [x] Deploy 1Password integrated with External Secrets
- [x] Add longhorn for persistent storage
- [x] Enable NFS for external storage access
- [x] Authentik for SSO/Passkey/Enroll
- [ ] User Landing Page (see below)
- [ ] Optimize core deployment
- [ ] Automation bot for working with PRs and automatically applying or group applying
- [ ] Observability Stack (see below)

## Observability Stack
- App
  Name: openobserve
  Namespace: monitoring
  Helm/OCI Repo:
  Replicas:
  ExternalSecret: openobserve-secret
  Values: document any values I would need and any that should be a secret so they can be populated
  Storage: [Longhorn, NFS]
  Route: internal only
  Hostnames: default, plus observe.{$SECRET_DOMAIN}

Decide on whether to add any of these additionally:
- kube-prometheus-stack
- grafana
- opentelemetry
- loki

## Fixarr
